title: "Authentication"

The billing.io API uses API keys to authenticate requests. Include your API key as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header of every request.

## API Keys

Your API keys carry access to your organization's data, so keep them secure. Do not share your secret API key in publicly accessible areas such as client-side code, GitHub repositories, or public forums.

| Environment | Key prefix    | Base URL                      |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Production  | `sk_live_`    | `https://api.billing.io/v1`   |
| Sandbox     | `sk_test_`    | `https://api.billing.io/v1`   |

Sandbox keys allow you to test your integration without processing real payments. All API functionality is available in both environments.

## Making Authenticated Requests

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header using the Bearer scheme:

```bash
curl https://api.billing.io/v1/checkouts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Organization-Scoped Access

API keys are scoped to your organization. All resources created with a key belong to that organization, and you can only access resources within your own organization. This means:

- A key created for Organization A cannot read or modify resources belonging to Organization B.
- All list endpoints return only resources belonging to the authenticated organization.
- Creating a resource automatically associates it with the key's organization.

## Error Responses

If authentication fails, the API returns a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "authentication_error",
    "code": "api_key_invalid",
    "message": "The API key provided is invalid.",
    "param": null
  }
}
```

Common authentication errors include:

- **Missing header** -- No `Authorization` header was provided.
- **Invalid key** -- The API key does not exist or has been revoked.
- **Wrong environment** -- Using a sandbox key against production resources or vice versa.

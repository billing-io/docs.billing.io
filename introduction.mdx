# Non-custodial crypto payments, built for developers

billing.io is a payment processing platform that lets merchants accept USDT and USDC across multiple blockchains. Payments go directly to your wallet -- billing.io never holds your funds.

## Why billing.io?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Non-custodial by design">
    Crypto payments are sent directly to your wallet address. billing.io monitors the blockchain, confirms transactions, and notifies you via webhooks. Your funds are always under your control.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multi-chain stablecoin support">
    Accept USDT and USDC on **Tron**, **Arbitrum**, and **Base**. Configure separate payment methods for each chain and token pair, set confirmation thresholds, and define amount limits.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Real-time webhook notifications">
    Get notified the moment a payment is detected, confirming, or completed. Webhook payloads are signed with HMAC-SHA256, and failed deliveries are retried with exponential backoff.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Full subscription lifecycle">
    Create plans with daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly intervals. Manage trials, renewals, cancellations, pauses, and feature entitlements through a single API.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Revenue operations built in">
    Track every payment, subscription charge, refund, and adjustment in an immutable revenue event ledger. Pull accounting period summaries for your books.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sandbox environment">
    Every API endpoint works in sandbox mode with `sk_test_` keys. Simulate payments, test webhooks, and validate your integration before going live.
  </Accordion>

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Merchant creates a checkout">
    Your backend calls `POST /checkouts` with an amount, chain, and token. billing.io returns a unique deposit address.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer sends crypto">
    The customer sends the exact stablecoin amount to the deposit address. billing.io's chain watcher monitors the blockchain for the incoming transaction.
  </Step>
  <Step title="billing.io confirms the payment">
    Once the transaction reaches the required number of block confirmations, the checkout status moves to `confirmed` and a `checkout.completed` webhook is fired.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Funds arrive in your wallet">
    Since billing.io is non-custodial, the funds were sent directly to your configured wallet address. No withdrawal step required.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Non-custodial crypto payments, built for developers

billing.io lets merchants accept USDT and USDC across multiple blockchains. Payments go directly to your wallet — billing.io never holds your funds.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a checkout">
    Your backend calls `POST /checkouts` with an amount, chain, and token. billing.io returns a unique deposit address.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer sends crypto">
    The customer sends stablecoins to the deposit address. billing.io monitors the blockchain for the transaction.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payment confirmed">
    Once the required block confirmations are reached, the checkout status becomes `confirmed` and a `checkout.completed` webhook fires.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Funds in your wallet">
    Since billing.io is [non-custodial](/what-is-non-custodial), funds were sent directly to your wallet. No withdrawal step needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Quick example

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.billing.io/v1/checkouts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BILLING_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount_usd": 49.99,
    "chain": "tron",
    "token": "USDT"
  }'
```

```javascript Node.js
import BillingIO from "@billing-io/sdk";

const billing = new BillingIO({ apiKey: process.env.BILLING_API_KEY });

const checkout = await billing.checkouts.create({
  amount_usd: 49.99,
  chain: "tron",
  token: "USDT",
});

console.log(checkout.deposit_address);
```

```python Python
from billingio import BillingIO

billing = BillingIO(api_key="sk_live_...")

checkout = billing.checkouts.create(
    amount_usd=49.99,
    chain="tron",
    token="USDT",
)

print(checkout.deposit_address)
```

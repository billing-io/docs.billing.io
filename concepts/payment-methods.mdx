A payment method is the receiving rail for your crypto payments. It tells billing.io which blockchain, token, and wallet to use when a customer pays you.

billing.io applies sensible, chain-specific defaults. Most users never need to change advanced settings.

<Info>
  Funds go directly to your wallet. billing.io is [non-custodial](/what-is-non-custodial) — it monitors the blockchain and confirms payments, but never holds your crypto.
</Info>

## How it works

A payment method combines three things into a single resource:

1. **Chain** — which blockchain network (Tron, Arbitrum, or Base)
2. **Token** — which stablecoin (USDT or USDC)
3. **Wallet** — which receiving address on that chain

When a customer pays, billing.io routes the payment to the wallet defined by the payment method and monitors the blockchain until the transaction is confirmed.

## Configuration

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `chain` | string | Blockchain network: `tron`, `arbitrum`, or `base` |
| `token` | string | Stablecoin: `USDT` or `USDC` |
| `wallet_id` | string | Reference to your registered wallet |
| `display_name` | string | Human-readable label (e.g., "USDT on Tron") |
| `min_amount_usd` | number | Minimum payment amount in USD (optional) |
| `max_amount_usd` | number | Maximum payment amount in USD (optional) |
| `is_default` | boolean | Whether this is the default payment method |
| `status` | string | `active` or `disabled` |

---

## Default payment method

One payment method can be marked as the **default**. It is used automatically when a checkout, payment link, or subscription does not specify a `payment_method_id`.

Setting a new default unsets the previous one.

---

## Wallets vs. payment methods

A **wallet** is a blockchain address you own — register it once under **Settings > Wallets**. A **payment method** is a configured receiving rail built on top of a wallet.

One wallet can back multiple payment methods. For example, a single Tron wallet could have one payment method for USDT and another for USDC, each with different amount limits.

---

## Status lifecycle

| Status | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `active` | Available for new checkouts and subscriptions |
| `disabled` | Cannot be used for new checkouts. In-flight payments continue to settle normally. |

<Accordion title="Advanced Security & Finality Settings">

The fields below control blockchain-level confirmation behavior. billing.io sets safe defaults per chain — most integrations do not need to change these.

### `required_confirmations`

The number of block confirmations billing.io waits before marking a payment as final. Higher values reduce the risk of chain reorganizations reversing a transaction.

| Chain | Default | Approximate Time |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| Tron | 20 blocks | ~60 seconds |
| Arbitrum | 12 blocks | ~3 seconds |
| Base | 12 blocks | ~24 seconds |

<Warning>
  Lowering `required_confirmations` increases speed but reduces finality assurance. Transactions with fewer confirmations have a higher probability of being reversed during a chain reorganization. Only change this if you understand the trade-off between speed and settlement safety.
</Warning>

### Chain reorganization risk

A **chain reorganization** (re-org) occurs when the blockchain rewrites recent history, potentially reversing confirmed transactions. The default confirmation thresholds are set to make re-org risk negligible for each supported chain.

- **Tron**: Delegated Proof of Stake with 27 super representatives. 20 confirmations provides strong finality.
- **Arbitrum**: Optimistic rollup anchored to Ethereum. 12 L2 confirmations is conservative for typical transactions.
- **Base**: Optimistic rollup anchored to Ethereum. Same model as Arbitrum.

If your use case involves high-value transactions and you want maximum safety, you can _increase_ the confirmation threshold above the default.

## Code examples

### Create a payment method

<CodeGroup>
```bash curl
curl -X POST https://api.billing.io/v1/payment-methods \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "chain": "tron",
    "token": "USDT",
    "wallet_id": "wal_abc123",
    "display_name": "USDT on Tron",
    "is_default": true
  }'
```

```javascript node.js
const response = await fetch("https://api.billing.io/v1/payment-methods", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    chain: "tron",
    token: "USDT",
    wallet_id: "wal_abc123",
    display_name: "USDT on Tron",
    is_default: true,
  }),
});

const paymentMethod = await response.json();
console.log(paymentMethod.id); // pm_a1b2c3d4e5f6...
```
</CodeGroup>

### List payment methods

<CodeGroup>
```bash curl
curl https://api.billing.io/v1/payment-methods \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```javascript node.js
const response = await fetch("https://api.billing.io/v1/payment-methods", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
  },
});

const { data } = await response.json();
// data: [{ id: "pm_...", chain: "tron", token: "USDT", ... }]
```
</CodeGroup>

### Set as default

<CodeGroup>
```bash curl
curl -X POST https://api.billing.io/v1/payment-methods/pm_a1b2c3d4e5f6/default \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```javascript node.js
const response = await fetch(
  "https://api.billing.io/v1/payment-methods/pm_a1b2c3d4e5f6/default",
  {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    },
  }
);
```
</CodeGroup>

### Disable a payment method

<CodeGroup>
```bash curl
curl -X PATCH https://api.billing.io/v1/payment-methods/pm_a1b2c3d4e5f6 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "status": "disabled" }'
```

```javascript node.js
const response = await fetch(
  "https://api.billing.io/v1/payment-methods/pm_a1b2c3d4e5f6",
  {
    method: "PATCH",
    headers: {
      Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ status: "disabled" }),
  }
);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Best practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="One method per chain-token pair" icon="layer-group">
    Keep your configuration clean with one payment method per chain and token combination.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Set amount limits" icon="shield">
    Use `min_amount_usd` to avoid dust payments and `max_amount_usd` to limit exposure per transaction.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Always have a default" icon="star">
    A default payment method prevents errors when checkouts or subscriptions are created without specifying one.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use display names" icon="tag">
    Clear `display_name` values help your team identify payment methods in the dashboard.

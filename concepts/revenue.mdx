billing.io provides a complete revenue tracking system built around three pillars:

| Pillar | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Revenue Events** | Immutable ledger of every monetary event |
| **Accounting Periods** | Aggregated summaries for financial reporting |
| **Adjustments** | Manual credits, debits, and chargebacks |

---

## Revenue events

Revenue events form an **immutable append-only ledger**. Every time money moves — a checkout is confirmed, a subscription is charged, a refund is issued — a revenue event is created. Events cannot be edited or deleted.

### Event types

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `checkout_confirmed` | One-time checkout payment confirmed on-chain |
| `subscription_charged` | Recurring subscription renewal confirmed on-chain |
| `refund` | Refund tracked for bookkeeping (merchant executes the actual refund) |
| `adjustment_credit` | Manual credit applied — increases net revenue |
| `adjustment_debit` | Manual debit applied — decreases net revenue |
| `chargeback` | Disputed transaction recorded for accounting |

<Note>
  Revenue events are immutable. To correct an error, create an adjustment (credit or debit)
  rather than modifying an existing event. This preserves the audit trail.
</Note>

## Accounting periods

The accounting view aggregates revenue events into period-level summaries:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Gross Revenue** | Total confirmed payments |
| **Fees** | billing.io orchestration fees |
| **Net Revenue** | Gross revenue minus fees |
| **Adjustments** | Sum of credits, debits, and chargebacks |
| **Adjusted Net** | Net revenue plus/minus adjustments |

## Adjustments

Adjustments are manual entries that modify revenue records. Each adjustment creates a corresponding revenue event, maintaining ledger integrity.

| Type | Effect | Revenue Event |
|------|--------|---------------|
| `credit` | Increases net revenue | `adjustment_credit` |
| `debit` | Decreases net revenue | `adjustment_debit` |
| `chargeback` | Decreases net revenue | `chargeback` |

<Warning>
  Adjustments cannot be deleted. To correct a mistake, create a counter-adjustment
  (e.g., a debit to offset an incorrect credit).
</Warning>

## CSV export

The accounting view supports CSV export for integration with external accounting systems (QuickBooks, Xero, spreadsheet applications). Exports include period dates, gross/net revenue, adjustment totals, and event counts.

<CodeGroup>
```bash curl
curl "https://api.billing.io/v1/revenue/events?limit=50" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```javascript node.js
const response = await fetch(
  "https://api.billing.io/v1/revenue/events?limit=50",
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    },
  }
);

const { data } = await response.json();
```
</CodeGroup>

### Get accounting summary

<CodeGroup>
```bash curl
curl "https://api.billing.io/v1/revenue/accounting?period=2025-01" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"

</CodeGroup>

### Create an adjustment

<CodeGroup>
```bash curl
curl -X POST https://api.billing.io/v1/revenue/adjustments \

    "customer_id": "cus_abc123def456",
    "checkout_id": "chk_xyz789"
  }'
```

```javascript node.js
const response = await fetch("https://api.billing.io/v1/revenue/adjustments", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    type: "credit",
    amount: 25.0,
    currency: "USD",
    reason: "Goodwill credit for delayed checkout confirmation",
    customer_id: "cus_abc123def456",
    checkout_id: "chk_xyz789",
  }),
});

const adjustment = await response.json();
```

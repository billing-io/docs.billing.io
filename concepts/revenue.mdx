## Overview

billing.io provides a complete revenue tracking system built around three pillars:

| Pillar | Purpose | Dashboard Location |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| **Revenue Events** | Immutable ledger of every monetary event | Revenue > Timeline |
| **Accounting Periods** | Aggregated summaries for financial reporting | Revenue > Accounting |
| **Adjustments** | Manual credits, debits, and chargebacks | Revenue > Adjustments |

Together, these give you a full picture of your crypto revenue -- from individual transaction events to period-level accounting summaries ready for export.

## Revenue Events

Revenue events form an **immutable append-only ledger**. Every time money moves -- a checkout is confirmed, a subscription is charged, a refund is issued -- a revenue event is created. These events cannot be edited or deleted, ensuring a complete audit trail.

Each revenue event records:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | Event ID (prefixed `rev_`) |
| `event_type` | Type of monetary event (see below) |
| `amount` | Dollar amount of the event |
| `currency` | Currency (typically `USD`) |
| `token` | Crypto token involved (USDT, USDC) |
| `chain` | Blockchain network |
| `tx_hash` | On-chain transaction hash (when applicable) |
| `description` | Human-readable description |
| `checkout_id` | Linked checkout (when applicable) |
| `subscription_id` | Linked subscription (when applicable) |
| `adjustment_id` | Linked adjustment (when applicable) |
| `occurred_at` | When the event occurred |

### Event Types

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="checkout_confirmed">
    A one-time checkout payment has been confirmed on-chain. This is the most common event type
    and represents direct revenue from a customer payment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="subscription_charged">
    A recurring subscription renewal payment has been confirmed on-chain. Created automatically
    when the chain-watcher confirms a subscription renewal checkout.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="refund">
    A refund has been issued. Since billing.io is non-custodial, refunds are tracked as revenue
    events for bookkeeping purposes. The actual refund transaction is executed by the merchant.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="adjustment_credit">
    A manual credit adjustment has been applied. This increases the net revenue for the period.
    Common use cases include goodwill credits and promotional adjustments.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="adjustment_debit">
    A manual debit adjustment has been applied. This decreases the net revenue for the period.
    Used for corrections and write-offs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="chargeback">
    A chargeback has been recorded. While crypto payments cannot be "charged back" in the
    traditional sense, this event type tracks disputed transactions and their resolution
    for accounting purposes.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Revenue events are **immutable**. To correct an error, create an adjustment (credit or debit)
  rather than trying to modify an existing event. This preserves the audit trail.
</Note>

## Accounting Periods

The accounting view aggregates revenue events into period-level summaries. Each period provides:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Gross Revenue** | Total confirmed payments (checkouts + subscription charges) |
| **Fees** | billing.io orchestration fees for the period |
| **Net Revenue** | Gross revenue minus fees |
| **Adjustments** | Sum of credits, debits, and chargebacks |
| **Adjusted Net** | Net revenue plus/minus adjustments |

### Revenue Timeline vs. Accounting View

billing.io offers two complementary ways to look at your revenue:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Revenue Timeline" icon="timeline">
    A chronological stream of individual revenue events. Use this view to see exactly what happened
    and when -- every checkout confirmation, every subscription charge, every adjustment. Best for
    investigating specific transactions and understanding the sequence of events.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Accounting View" icon="calculator">
    Aggregated summaries grouped by accounting period. Use this view for financial reporting,
    month-end reconciliation, and CSV exports. Best for understanding overall business
    performance and preparing financial statements.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Adjustments

Adjustments are manual entries that modify your revenue records. Every adjustment creates a corresponding revenue event, maintaining the integrity of the immutable ledger.

### Adjustment Types

| Type | Effect on Revenue | Revenue Event Created |
|------|-------------------|----------------------|
| `credit` | Increases net revenue | `adjustment_credit` |
| `debit` | Decreases net revenue | `adjustment_debit` |
| `chargeback` | Decreases net revenue | `chargeback` |

Each adjustment includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | Adjustment ID (prefixed `adj_`) |
| `type` | `credit`, `debit`, or `chargeback` |
| `amount` | Dollar amount |
| `currency` | Currency code |
| `reason` | Human-readable explanation (required) |
| `checkout_id` | Linked checkout (optional) |
| `subscription_id` | Linked subscription (optional) |
| `customer_id` | Linked customer (optional) |
| `revenue_event_id` | The revenue event created by this adjustment |

<Warning>
  Adjustments cannot be deleted. If you create an adjustment in error, create a counter-adjustment
  (e.g., a debit to offset an incorrect credit). This preserves the full audit trail.
</Warning>

### Common Adjustment Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Goodwill credit">
    A customer had a poor experience and you want to credit their account. Create a `credit`
    adjustment with a clear reason for the audit trail.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Overpayment correction">
    A customer overpaid on a checkout. Create a `credit` adjustment for the difference
    and link it to the checkout and customer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Disputed transaction">
    A customer disputes a payment. Create a `chargeback` adjustment to record the dispute.
    Link it to the original checkout for traceability.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Accounting correction">
    An entry was recorded incorrectly. Create a `debit` or `credit` adjustment to correct
    the error, with a reason explaining the correction.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## CSV Export

The accounting view supports CSV export for integration with external accounting systems. The export includes:

- Period start and end dates
- Gross revenue, fees, net revenue
- Adjustment totals (credits, debits, chargebacks)
- Adjusted net revenue
- Event counts per type

<Tip>
  Use CSV exports for monthly reconciliation with your accounting software. The export format
  is designed to be compatible with common accounting tools like QuickBooks, Xero, and
  spreadsheet applications.

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Always provide a reason" icon="message">
    When creating adjustments, write clear, specific reasons. These become part of the
    permanent audit trail and are invaluable during accounting reviews.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Link adjustments to resources" icon="link">
    Always link adjustments to the relevant checkout, subscription, or customer.
    This makes reconciliation and auditing significantly easier.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Export monthly" icon="download">
    Set a recurring reminder to export your accounting data monthly. This ensures
    your external accounting system stays in sync and simplifies year-end reporting.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review discrepancies promptly" icon="magnifying-glass">
    If the accounting view shows unexpected numbers, drill into the revenue timeline
    to identify specific events. Address discrepancies before the period closes.
  </Card>

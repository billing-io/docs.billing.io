# What is non-custodial?

With a traditional payment processor like Stripe or PayPal, your customer's money goes to the processor first. The processor holds it, takes a cut, and then sends you the rest days or weeks later. Your revenue sits in someone else's bank account until they decide to release it.

**billing.io works differently.** When your customer pays, the crypto goes **directly from their wallet to yours**. billing.io watches the blockchain, confirms the payment landed, and sends you a webhook notification. That's it. We never hold, touch, or have access to your funds at any point.

<Tip>
**Think of it like this:** billing.io is a security camera watching your mailbox. It sees when a delivery arrives, confirms it's the right package, and texts you -- but it never opens or touches anything.
</Tip>

## How traditional processors work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customer pays">
    Your customer sends money to **the processor's account**, not yours.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Processor holds the funds">
    The processor sits on your money. They decide when to release it -- usually on a schedule (weekly, monthly, or with a rolling reserve).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Processor takes their cut">
    Fees are deducted before you see a penny.
  </Step>
  <Step title="You eventually get paid">
    Days or weeks later, the processor sends what's left to your bank account. If they freeze your account, you might wait months -- or never get it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How billing.io works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customer pays">
    Your customer sends crypto **directly to your wallet address**. The funds are yours the moment the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain.
  </Step>
  <Step title="billing.io watches the blockchain">
    Our chain watcher monitors the transaction, counts block confirmations, and tracks the payment status in real time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="You get notified">
    Once the payment is confirmed, billing.io fires a `checkout.completed` webhook to your server. That's our only job.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## See it in code

Here's the entire non-custodial payment flow in code -- create a checkout, and handle the confirmation webhook:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Node.js
// 1. Create a checkout -- generates a deposit address
const checkout = await billing.checkouts.create({
  amount_usd: 100.00,
  chain: "tron",
  token: "USDT",
});
// Customer sends USDT directly to checkout.deposit_address
// Funds go straight to YOUR wallet -- billing.io never touches them

// 2. Handle the webhook when payment confirms
app.post("/webhooks/billing", (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;
  if (event.type === "checkout.completed") {
    // Payment confirmed on-chain -- funds are already in your wallet
    console.log(`Received $${event.data.amount_usd} USDT`);
    console.log(`Tx: ${event.data.tx_hash}`);
  }
  res.sendStatus(200);
});
```

```python Python
# 1. Create a checkout -- generates a deposit address
checkout = billing.checkouts.create(
    amount_usd=100.00,
    chain="tron",
    token="USDT",
)
# Customer sends USDT directly to checkout.deposit_address
# Funds go straight to YOUR wallet -- billing.io never touches them

# 2. Handle the webhook when payment confirms (Flask)
@app.route("/webhooks/billing", methods=["POST"])
def handle_webhook():
    event = request.get_json()
    if event["type"] == "checkout.completed":
        # Payment confirmed on-chain -- funds are already in your wallet
        print(f"Received ${event['data']['amount_usd']} USDT")
        print(f"Tx: {event['data']['tx_hash']}")
    return "", 200
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
There is no step 4. Your funds are already in your wallet. There's nothing to withdraw, no payout to wait for, and no one standing between you and your money.
</Note>

## Why this matters

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="No frozen accounts" icon="shield-check">
    Your money is in your wallet the moment it arrives. No processor can freeze your account, hold your funds, or shut you down overnight.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No payout delays" icon="clock">
    There's no "payout schedule" because funds settle directly to you on-chain. You have your money in minutes, not days or weeks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No counterparty risk" icon="lock">
    billing.io literally cannot lose your money because we never have it. If billing.io disappeared tomorrow, your funds would be unaffected.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Full transparency" icon="eye">
    Every transaction is verifiable on the public blockchain. You don't have to trust anyone's internal ledger -- you can verify it yourself.

## What billing.io actually does

If we never touch your money, what do we do? We handle everything around the payment:

- **Generate unique deposit addresses** so each checkout maps to a specific payment
- **Monitor the blockchain** in real time to detect incoming transactions
- **Count block confirmations** to make sure payments are final and irreversible
- **Send webhook notifications** so your backend knows the instant a payment is confirmed
- **Manage subscriptions** by tracking renewal dates and creating checkout sessions automatically
- **Provide dashboards and APIs** so you can manage everything programmatically

We're the infrastructure layer that makes accepting crypto payments simple -- without ever being in the flow of funds.
